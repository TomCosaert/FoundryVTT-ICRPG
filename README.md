# Index Card RPG System for Foundry VTT

[Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/) (**Foundry VTT**) is a standalone application built for experiencing multiplayer tabletop RPGs using a feature-rich and modern self-hosted application where your players connect directly through the browser.

[Index Card RPG](https://www.icrpg.com/) (**ICRPG**) by [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online/) takes classic tabletop mechanics for telling stories, making monsters and rolling dice, but throws out all the clunky parts that keep most folks from trying an adventure or two.

This **Game System** for Foundry VTT allows easy creation and management of ICRPG player characters, NPCs and items.

> Foundry VTT users now have no excuses anymore to not be playing ICRPG!

## Features

To highlight some of its **features** that might not be obvious at first glance:
- Character sheet attributes are **roll-able** to the chat window by clicking the Stats, Effort, Dying, Revive labels in the Attributes tab, or the Loot label in the Gear tab. If applicable, any modifiers are automatically applied to the roll.
- The character sheet allows **adding new items** without having to first create them as stand-alone ones, by clicking the plus icon.
- Any owned item's **equipped state** is easily toggled using the star icon from the item list itself — no need to open the item window to change it.
- An excerpt of the **item's description** gets displayed underneath each item name in the item list. Click the item's name to open the item window and read the full description.

Items currently do not support attributes to be automatically added to the loot values of the character sheet. This is something users have to track themselves for now.

The following languages are currently supported: **English**, **Spanish**, **German** and **Dutch**. Reach out if you feel like contributing!

## Attribution

Many thanks to Brandish Gilhelm (also known as Hankerin Ferinale) of [Runehammer Games](https://www.runehammer.online/) for designing Index Card RPG! I acquired his **permission** to make this game system available to the Foundry VTT community as-is, without including any source material content such as item loot tables as compendia.

Thanks to Diego Martinez for the Spanish localization!
